The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.

The open() function takes 2 parameters: filename, mode.


There are four different methods(modes) for opening a file: 

'r' - Read - Default value. Opens file for reading. Error if file NOT exist.

'a' - Append - Opens a file for appending. Creates file if NOT exist. 

'w' - Write - Opens a file for writing. Creates file if NOT exist.

'x' - Create - Creates the specified file. Returns an error if file exist.


In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:

't' - Text - Default value. Text mode. 

'b' - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

Make sure the file exists or you will get an error.

Always close your files, related to buffering changes made to a file may not show until you close a file.
