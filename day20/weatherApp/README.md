- Get current weather based on user's geolocation.
- Displays weather status, temperature, and country.
<br />
<br />
A good understanding of Python and Pygame would be beneficial to helping you create this project. However, it is always good practice to refer to the Documentation available when developing ***any*** project. 

_Please refer to the [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) for your reference._

_The standard shell of Python, or REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) allows you to run Python code interactively as you work on a project or are in the process of learning this programming language. You may find it useful to vist the [Getting the Most Out of the Python Standard REPL website](https://realpython.com/python-repl/) to further your understanding and produce better results._

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python >= 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
- [OpenWeatherMap API Key](https://openweathermap.org/api)



### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AmberForrester/Python-Code.git
  ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
  ```bash
  cd Python-Code/day20/weatherApp
  ```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment:**

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies.

For **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

For **Mac/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:** 

- For **Windows users:** 

Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following content:
```bash
API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key
```

Replace your `your_openweathermap_api_key` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.

### How to Run the Application

Once everything is set up, you can start the Flask development server:

Open your terminal in the project directory and run the following command: 
```bash
flask run
```

By default, Flask runs on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your browser to access the app.



## How to Use

1. **Search by City:** Enter a city name in the input field and click "Submit" to view the weather for that city.

2. **Use Current Location:** Click "Use Current Location" to get weather details based on your browser's geolocation.
