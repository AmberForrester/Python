# P3: Declare two number variables and find the remainder - 

# Define two numbers:
number1 = 15
number2 = 4

# Find the remainder using the modulus operator `%` when number1 is divided by number2:
remainder = number1 % number2

# Print the result as remainder:
print("The remainder when", number1, "is divided by", number2, "is:", remainder)
