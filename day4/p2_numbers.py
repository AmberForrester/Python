# P2: Declare two numbers variables and find the remainder - 

# Define two numbers and assign values to `number1` and `number2`:
number1 = 5
number2 = 7

# Add the numbers using the + operator, storing the result in the variable called `result`: 
result = number1 + number2

# Print the result using the `print()` function: 
print("The sum of", number1, "and", number2, "is:", result)
